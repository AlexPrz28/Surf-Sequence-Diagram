program that prints the 3 places of a contest from .txt file

In order to run the program, you must have a file path (e.g @"C:\Users\YourUserName\Desktop\yourFile.txt")
The .txt file must be written with the name and position, like this: "Ronald 45". the program will separate the number and the score with the space between them.

The .txt file can be anywhere but you must have the correct file path to run the project.
